# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest release on `main` and the latest tagged version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to the maintainers with:

- affected version
- reproduction steps
- potential impact

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as quickly as possible.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit workspace keys or tokens.
- Prefer environment variables for secrets.
- Treat generated run outputs as potentially sensitive operational data.
